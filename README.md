# About this project

Using this website, we can learn about the currency exchange rates between two countries by entering their respective country currency codes. This is a fully functional responsive web app built with HTML CSS and Pure JavaScript. As we all know, the rate is not fixed and can change at any time. To solve this problem and dynamically change the exchange rate, I used an API called 'Exchange-rate-api.'
